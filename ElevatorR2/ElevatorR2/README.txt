This was made using Visual Studio 2013. If you want it to build properly I suggest you use the same since I don't know how it'll handle transferring down to an older version.

When running from within Visual Studio the database file it uses is bin/Release/elevatorDB.accdb. The database file in the main directory is used as a template and is copied over when the program is built or published.
