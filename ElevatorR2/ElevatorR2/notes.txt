Stuff to do before release:
///- Set doors to be closed when first starting. Both doors starting open and closing at the start is stupid.
///- Remove pointless methods like "SomeBackgroundImg_onClick()" that were automatically made.
///- Clean up the endless torrent of comments that infests ElevatorGUI.
///- Set logical delays between the doors doing something and the lift moving.
///- Set logical delays between the interior buttons being pressed and the lift doing stuff.
///- Sort out database when publishing. It doesn't package the database file with it for some reason.
///- Change that hideous placeholder lift image.
///- Move all the images used in elevatorGUI to the project resources, not the specific class resources.
///- NAME ALL THOSE DAMN PICTUREBOXES
